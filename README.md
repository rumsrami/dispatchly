DISPATCHLY - RoseRocket Coding Challenge
============

## Usage - Local environment

### Using docker-compose

### Using Make

1. Install Go v1.14+
- `make tools` to install tools (colored testing, vendoring).
- `make build` to build the binary.
- `make run` to run using sane defaults.
- `make run-help` to see usage example.
- `make test` to run tests.
- `make test-color` to run tests with colors (`make tools` required).

### Build and run the binary directly without Make

- From the console at the root directory:
>  1. `$ make build` </br>
>  2. `$ ./bin/dispatch`
